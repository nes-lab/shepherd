Virtual Source OLD
==================

.. warning::
   This information is deprecated. The current implementation is more complex.

Emulator
---------

In addition to regular emulation, shepherd provides VirtCap.
VirtCap uses an algorithm to completely virtualize the DC/DC converter and storage capacitor.
With VirtCap, users emulate any DC/DC converter.
Also the capacitor size is software configurable.
This allows to do a test sweep over various capacitor sizes,
without having to hand replace them by hand.
VirtCap is configured by means of yml-file.

Example usage:

.. code-block:: bash

    sepherd-sheep emulator --config virtcap_settings.yml /var/shepherd/recordings/rec.0.h

:lookup_output_efficiency:

    Each element represents input efficiency for a given output current. Since there is no floating point support,
    efficiency is defined as: :math:`0-100 \% \times 4096`

    | First row defines output efficiency for 0.01--0.09mA.

Recording
---------
The algorithm assumes that the input power traces, is recorded with the same converter as the converter you are trying to emulate.
This means that if only BQ255xx devices can be emulated using the recording option in Shepherd. It is however possible to record the input power trace with another device, and then convert those readings in the format of Shepherd (.h5).

Model
-----

The basics of the model are based on
the work of :raw-latex:`\cite{de2010design}`. The model is extended by
introducing a converter and adding other improvements.

Capacitor Voltage Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start from the current-voltage relation of a capacitor

.. math::

   \label{eq:iv-cap}
   V_{\text{cap}}(t) = \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^{t} I(\tau)d\tau + V_{\text{cap}}(t_0),

where :math:`V_{\text{cap}}(t)` is the capacitor voltage, :math:`C` is
the capacitance, :math:`I(\tau)` is the sum of in- and outgoing current
over a period of :math:`d\tau` and :math:`V_{\text{cap}}(t_0)` is the
initial capacitor voltage at :math:`t = 0`.

By taking the derivative of `[eq:iv-cap] <#eq:iv-cap>`__, we get

.. math::

   \label{eq:iv-cap-der}
     \Delta V_{\text{cap}} = \frac{\Delta I \Delta t}{C}.

We now define :math:`V_{\text{cap}}(n)` as a discrete function,
implementing the integral of `[eq:iv-cap] <#eq:iv-cap>`__ as

.. math::

   \label{eq:vcap}
     \begin{cases}
       V_{\text{cap}}(0) = V_{\text{lt}},\\
       V_{\text{cap}}(n) = V_{\text{cap}}(n-1) + \Delta V_{\text{cap}},
     \end{cases}

where :math:`n` is an integer indicating the iteration of the function
and :math:`V_{\text{lt}}` the lower threshold capacitor voltage at which
the output turns off.

We define :math:`\Delta I` as

.. math::

   \label{eq:sumcurrent}
     \Delta I = I_{\text{cin}} - I_{\text{cout}} - I_{\text{leakage}},

where :math:`I_{\text{cin}}` is input current charging the capacitor,
:math:`I_{\text{cout}}` is current flowing out of the capacitor based on
the load and :math:`{I_{\text{leakage}}}` is the static leakage current
of the capacitor. :math:`I_{\text{cin}}` is derived as

.. math::

   \label{eq:capin}
     I_{\text{cin}} = I_{\text{in}}\frac{V_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{cap}}}\eta_{\text{in}}(I_{\text{in}}, V_{\text{in}}),

where :math:`V_{\text{cap}}` is the voltage on the capacitor and
:math:`\eta_{\text{in}}(I_{\text{in}}, V_{\text{in}})` is the input
efficiency of the converter as function of input current
:math:`I_{\text{in}}` and input voltage :math:`V_{\text{in}}`. Note that
a converter can be composed of two stages. The first stage converts the
input voltage to the capacitor voltage. The second stage converts the
capacitor voltage to the desired output voltage.
:math:`\eta_{\text{in}}` and :math:`\eta_{\text{out}}` define the
efficiency of the first and second stage. Some converters only have the
first stage and directly output the capacitor voltage to the load.

:math:`I_{\text{cout}}` is defined as

.. math::

   \label{eq:capout}
     I_{\text{cout}} = I_{\text{out}}\frac{V_{\text{out}}}{V_{\text{cap}}\eta_{\text{out}}(I_{\text{out}}, V_{\text{out}})},

where :math:`I_{\text{out}}` is the measured output current flowing into
the load, :math:`V_{\text{out}}` is the measured output voltage applied
to the load and
:math:`\eta_{\text{out}}(I_{\text{out}}, V_{\text{out}})` is the output
efficiency as function of output current :math:`I_{\text{out}}` and
output voltage :math:`V_{\text{out}}`. :math:`V_{\text{out}}` gets
determined by

.. math::

   \label{eq:vout}
     V_{\text{out}} = V_{on} b(n, V_{\text{cap}}),

where :math:`V_{on}` is the voltage when the output is on,
:math:`b(n, V_{cap})` is a boolean determining the output state as
function of the capacitor voltage defined as

.. math::

   \begin{cases}
       b(0)(V_{\text{cap}}) = \text{false}, \\
       b(n)(V_{\text{cap}}) =
       \begin{cases}
         \text{true},       & \text{if } \text{not}(b(n-1)) \text{\ and\ } (V_{\text{cap}} > V_{\text{ut}}), \\
         \text{false},       & \text{if } b(n-1) \text{\ and\ } (V_{\text{cap}}, < V_{\text{lt}}), \\
         b_{n-1,} & \text{otherwise},
       \end{cases}
     \end{cases}

where :math:`V_{\text{ut}}` is the upper threshold capacitor voltage and
:math:`V_{\text{lt}}` the lower threshold capacitor voltage at which,
respectively, the output turns on and off.

Output Capacitor Compensation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Converters can have a small output capacitor. When the output turns on,
the bigger storage capacitor instantly charges the output capacitor.
This causes the storage capacitor voltage to drop as shown in
FigureÂ \ `1.1 <#fig:vcap-drop>`__. To increase the accuracy of our
emulation we model this voltage drop by calculating
:math:`V_{\text{new}}`.

As the output turns on, energy will transfer between the capacitors,
defined as

.. math::

   \label{eq:energy-eq}
     E_{\text{new}} = E_{\text{old}} - E_{\text{output}},

where :math:`E_{\text{new}}` and :math:`E_{\text{old}}` is the energy
level in the storage capacitor before and after the output turns on
respectively; :math:`E_{\text{output}}` is the energy stored in the
output capacitor. We are interested in the capacitor voltage. The
relation between capacitor voltage and energy is defined as

.. math::

   \label{eq:energy-cap}
     E = \frac{CV^2}{2},

where :math:`E` is the energy in the capacitor, :math:`C` is the
capacitance and :math:`V` the capacitor voltage. We combine
`[eq:energy-cap] <#eq:energy-cap>`__ and
`[eq:energy-eq] <#eq:energy-eq>`__

.. math::

   \label{eq:energy-cap-eq}
     \frac{C_{\text{storage}}V_{\text{new}}^2}{2} = \frac{C_{\text{storage}}V_{\text{old}}^2}{2} - \frac{C_{\text{output}}V_{\text{new}}^2}{2}.

Rewriting `[eq:energy-cap-eq] <#eq:energy-cap-eq>`__ we get

.. math::

   \label{eq:vout-eq2}
     V_{\text{new}} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{\text{storage}}}{C_{\text{storage}} + C_{\text{output}}}}V_{\text{old}}.
