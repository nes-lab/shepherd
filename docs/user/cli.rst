Command-line tools
==================

Shepherd offers two command line utilities:

`Shepherd-herd`_ is the command line utility for remotely controlling a group of shepherd nodes.
This is the key user interface to shepherd.
The pure-python package is installed on the user's local machine and sends commands to the shepherd nodes over *ssh*.

To simplify usage you should set up an ansible style, YAML-formatted inventory file named ``herd.yml`` in either of these directories (with highest priority first):

- relative to your current working directory in ``inventory/herd.yml``
- in your local home-directory ``~/herd.yml``
- in the config path ``/etc/shepherd/herd.yml`` (**recommendation**)

Refer to the example ``herd.yml`` file in the ``inventory`` directory of the shepherd repository.

`Shepherd-sheep`_ is the command line utility for locally controlling a single shepherd node.
Depending on your use-case you may not even need to directly interact with it!
