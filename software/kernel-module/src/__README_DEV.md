# Kernel Dev

A good starting point for online literature:

- [Elixir Cross Referencer](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.19.94/A/ident/memremap)
  - good for finding from where to include functionality, also configuration is explained in the source
- [Doc for kernel 4.19](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/core-api/index.html#)
  - most basic APIs are described there, including some good practices
- free Book [Linux Device Drivers](https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/)
